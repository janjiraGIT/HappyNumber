# HappyNumber
Happy Numbers! A happy number is a number where you can take the sum of the square digits and then repeat on the new sum until you reach 1. The number is not a happy number (unhappy number) if it ends in a never ending loop. Example of a happy number: 31 => 3^2 + 1^2 => 10 => 1^2 + 0^2 = 1 Example of an unhappy number: 4 => 16 => 37 => 58 => 89 =>145 => 42 => 20 >= 4
